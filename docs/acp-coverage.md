# ACP Coverage

This file tracks which ACP methods and events Talaria handles.

## MVP Required

- `initialize`
- `session/new`
- `session/load`
- `session/prompt`
- `session/cancel`
- text deltas
- reasoning or thinking deltas
- tool start, progress, and completion events
- permission requests
- diff payloads

## Current Scaffold

The codebase currently includes JSON-RPC framing and minimal initialize request models. Full vendored ACP schema coverage is the first Sprint 1 task.
